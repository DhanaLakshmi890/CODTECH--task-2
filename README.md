Project Overview
Purpose
The project is a Simple Calculator application built using Python's Tkinter library. It provides a graphical user interface for performing basic arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Features
Graphical User Interface (GUI)

A display area that shows the current arithmetic expression and the result.
Buttons for digits (0-9) and basic arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /).
A clear button ('C') to reset the display.
An equal button ('=') to evaluate and display the result of the current expression.
Functionality

Expression Building: Users can build arithmetic expressions by clicking on digit and operator buttons.
Evaluation: When the equal button is clicked, the current expression is evaluated, and the result is displayed in the entry field.
Error Handling: If the expression is invalid, an error message is shown.
Clear Display: The clear button resets the display, allowing users to start a new calculation.
Detailed Workflow
User Interface Design

The calculator's user interface consists of an entry widget for displaying the current expression and result, and a grid of buttons for digits, operators, the clear function, and the equals function.
Event Handling

Each button is associated with an event handler that updates the display based on the button clicked.
Digits and operators are appended to the current expression in the display.
The clear button resets the display to an empty state.
The equal button evaluates the current expression and updates the display with the result or an error message if the expression is invalid.
Main Application Loop

The application starts by creating the main window and configuring the GUI elements.
The Tkinter main loop runs, waiting for user interactions such as button clicks to update the display and process expressions.
Summary
This Simple Calculator project leverages Python's Tkinter library to create an intuitive and functional calculator application. By organizing the code into well-defined components and handling user interactions efficiently, the project demonstrates basic GUI programming and event-driven development in Python.
